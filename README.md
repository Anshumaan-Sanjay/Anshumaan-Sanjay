- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anshumaan-Sanjay
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding
- I am excited to share my journey and experiences in the field of computer science and technology. Throughout my academic years, I have been immersed in a wide range of courses that have exposed me to various aspects of software development, data analysis, and computer systems.
- During my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. I have enjoyed working on projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively, from building simple command-line applications to more complex web-based projects. These experiences have not only improved my coding skills but have also given me a deeper understanding of software architecture and design principles.
